                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>This is makeup made to feel good in, without hiding what makes you unique because<br> Rare Beauty is not about being someone else, but being who you are.</p>
                <p>We are on a mission to help everyone celebrate their individuality by redefining what beautiful means.<br> We want to promote self-acceptance and give people the tools they need to feel less alone in the world. ​</p>
                <p>Our vision is to create a safe, welcoming space in beauty—and beyond—that supports mental well-being across age,<br> gender identity, sexual orientation, race, cultural background, physical or mental ability, and perspective. ​</p>
                <p> We believe in the beauty of imperfections.
                    We nurture a caring, respectful community. ​<br>
                    We create meaningful connections and relationships.​
                    We champion authenticity and positivity.<br>
                    ​We lead with transparency to build trust.
                    ​We believe there is power in being vulnerable</p>
